--------------------------------------
Unity Version Used: 2019.3.10f1
Target: Android, PC, Mac
Game Type: Runner
Theme: Sci-Fi
3D/2D: 3D 


Here is the Unity Project that I've made to apply for a Game Programmer role in Gamaga company, the game is a 3D runner where the player must evade lasers and obstacles in the level and reach the ed of it.


Development Known Issues
**************************************
-If you use Random laser speed attribute when create the Scriptable object for a turret, there's a slightly chance that the laser becomes unavoidable for the player, this is affected depending on the device is played
-Drag movement must be improved in android devices, I tried to to it by myself without using any script asset from the marketplace.
-With the aiming turret there's a little chance that the projectile collides with the turret itself in certain rotation angles.
